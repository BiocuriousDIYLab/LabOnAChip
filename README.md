### WHAT IS A LAB-ON-A-CHIP, ANYWAY?

This miniaturized device will integrate single to multiple analyses (this will be discussed) onto a single chip. You may want to browse this online tutorial to get a better idea (or simply google 'lab on a chip' for more information): http://bit.ly/1PVjW1k

### WHAT EXACTLY IS MICROFLUIDICS?

Microfluidics deals with the flow of fluids inside micrometer-size channels. To be considered 'micro' at least one dimension of the channel must be within the scale of one single to tens of micrometers. This science studies the behavior of fluids and also includes the manufacturing of or technology required to build such devices (as in manufacturing of microfluidics devices like our 'Lab on a chip'!) 

Fluids behave differently at the varying scales of nanofluidics, microfluidics & millifluidics. 

### ORGANIZER

This project will be led by Eric Harness, our resident equipment guru.

### NOTES

A laptop or other device to do research and computer work is highly suggested for this community project.

This repo serves as the home for all the software which may be used for this project.
